title: My journey to becoming a web developer!
--



First, let me introduce myself. My name is Sanjana, and
I’m doing full stack developer internship at Bloc. Starting this internship was a huge leap for me because I had no experience doing web development — and not any programming experience.This field was completely new to me.This is my first blog post.











### **Begin with Basics**

>I’ll start off with my journey, including what I gained, what went wrong and what I gave up (yes! I did) along the way.

>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What should I learn and where do I learn?” After doing lots of research, I ended up choosing my learning path based on what most entry-level web developer positions asked for, which was:

 * _HTML_

* _CSS_

* _Git_

* _jQuery_

* _AngularJS_

* _Ruby_

* _NodeJS_

…._and still exploring._

+ **Here’s how it’s going.**

I began my Journey through CodeSchool, youtube tutorials and whatever I found online. It took me few months to get accustomed with programming terminology, my mac keyboard, keyboard shortcuts (still working on it ), simple settings in laptop, knowing about different operating systems, text editor and many more basic things.


I was trying to grasp so many new things in the beginning and often it became tiring and overwhelming for me to retain everything.<br>

I started HTML & CSS on Codecademy, found learning resources like this were the best when you are just getting started. I could go through few times what I didn’t understand and was self paced and free.

+ **A step further...**
Once I got the basics out of the way, and felt little confident, I started Bloc Internship. It is a well designed online program. It’s curriculum  is very current with IT industry trend and always keep updating.You don’t have to guess anything, they took care of all fundamentals as well as advanced topics.
The curriculum includes all above and much more.
 I did HTML and CSS and basics of JavaScript.



+ **Git Horror**

After basics , I was introduced to GitHub and Git.It was nightmare for me.I
could do only few Git commands. It gave me really hard time. I was very confused and didn’t understand the working at all. I got help many times but it was huge challenge for me. I was very frustrated and wanted to give up. It took me over 2 - 3 months to become little comfortable with GitHub. Now I can say I am much more comfortable.


+ **Command line**

I had to learn command line.Very useful and fast.I got it faster than GitHub.


+ **First music player**

From here I was introduced advance CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery I finished a project which is a music player last week.When I clicked on first song , it started playing…..paused it…..it worked. Then fast forwarded ….rewinded  …..time and volume bars working …..it’s working!!  _Ultimate  happiness!!_


+ **Take away**


I am done less than half of Bloc curriculum. Long way to go. All ups and downs  in my web development journey till here was very interesting.I have learned  technical skills for sure. But the valuable lesson for me was resilience, patience, learn from others web developers and now I have lot of respect for their hard earned skill-set, staying positive and live my other aspects of life too.

_**........And finally Hard Work beats all odds.**_
