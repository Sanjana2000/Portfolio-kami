## Explanation

It’s easy to get swept up in the moment when eating, but being aware of your environment and how it affects your choices can help you stay on track. Knowing about these auditory clues can help you be more mindful about how you eat and your food choices.

_“Hearing is something that we just can’t turn off,”_ says Charles Spence, PhD, a professor at Oxford University, and author of Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating.

Read an 2010 article published in **_Perception_** entitled **_“ A sweet sound? Food names reveal implicit associations between taste and pitch"_**._"We live in a world of rich multisensory experiences, within which eating is one of the most evocative.If music and sound are used while eating,it changes our association, mood and taste of food._

I implemented a redesign on my own simple music player.My goal was to categorize the songs based on behavioural pshchology of music in food selection.Certain kind of music can promote user's healthy choice during shopping , can be heard during meal preparation which might make user lean towards healthy ingredients , setting calm mood during eating at home might make user to eat slowly and feel satisfied.

  **_PsyPost_** explains that music has been shown to influence the intake of food and fluid.It can do this by affecting and regulating mood states and increasing arousal by changing psysiological response (e.g. by increasing heart rate).For instance, a number of factors have been shown to have a higher arousing potential: loud music, music with vocals, familliarity of the music.

## Problem

**I had two main problems:**
1\. My original music player had few genre of music. Not much thought were given about choice of songs.It was categorized based on general trend of music.
It was huge challenge for me and that was how to categorize song-lists.What kind of sound should I include in each song category which might impact certain emotions , mood of user.

2.  Its had very plain looking landing page which did not give insight what kind of music user can expect from my music player.
    By look and feel of player, it was not appealing at all.I would say it was very boring looking music player.We know that human mind make decision in first 2-3 seconds of liking/disling based on appearance or presentation.So I wanted to improve the presentation of music player.

3.  Choosing an appropriate name.
    Looked up for the synonyms of food which looked little different from regular words but short & easy to remember.I liked **_Nosh_** which means food in **_thesaurus.com_**.

### Solution

For choice of sound and genre, I did research about effects of various sounds on human brain.Read articles published by various universities and food magazines.
I have selected song-categories carefully by adding low pitch, high pitch, loud, soft, Jazz, classical & more based on its effect on user's mood and how it will influence choice of food user might make.

I am including few studies here which shows why my NoshMusic player is useful:

1.  According to a study published this March in
    **_Psychology of Music_**: _“Unconscious effects of auditory stimuli should not be underestimated when looking at potential influencing factors that impact people’s food intake given that, on one hand, the majority of people tend to eat too much but on the other hand, specific population groups such as the institutionalized elderly also tend to eat too little.”_ Therefore, finding new ways to promote or decrease food intake can be beneficial in many clinical and non-clinical settings.

_“Hearing is something that we just can’t turn off,”_ says Charles Spence, PhD, a professor at Oxford University, and author of Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating.

 2.  Another article publised in **_Weight Watchers_** explanins:

_“Our brains are always picking up the background sensory cues from the environment and integrating them into the experience, whether we realize it or not.” Listening to music can cause both physical and emotional responses, making it doubly powerful when accompanied with food._

That spur-of-the-moment decision you made to splurge on an expensive glass of wine at the bar? Spence’s research suggests there may have been classical music playing at the time, which can send a subtle signal to your brain that it’s OK to spend more than usual on food and drinks. The way you plowed through your entrée while dining out over the weekend? The background music may have had a fast tempo, causing you to automatically increase the pace of your hand-to-mouth motions.

**1. Music is loud.**
The distraction of blaring tunes can make it hard to hear your friends, and may impede your ability to pick up on flavors. _“If music is too loud, it can suppress your ability to taste the food.When music is extra loud, it may become a dominant influence."_"

**2.Music pairs with food.**
Music can actually turn up the taste at mealtime. _“You can play specific types of music to sonically season a dish,”_ says Spence's research.

has shown that restaurants can bring out sweetness, spiciness, creaminess, or bitterness in a dish simply by playing matching music. (No wonder takeout never tastes as good!) _“One cafe just opened up in Vietnam where they play only sweet music—think tinkling, high-pitched piano or wind chimes. The idea is that they’ll be able to add a little less sugar to their cakes and drinks.”_

**3.Music reflects a food of certain region.**

Culturally specific music can put your mind and your mouth in the mood for specific types of cuisine. _“If you are in an ethnic restaurant, then playing music that people associate with that region can lead to food being rated as more authentically ethnic,”_  says Spence. Meaning: listening to the music of the country makes cultural dishes taste more authentic. For example, kimchi and bibimbap may taste more authentically Korean when served with a side of K-pop, a popular style of **Korean music**.

 Regional music can also influence your purchases, according to other studies says Spence. When at the store, you may be swayed to choose German wine over French (or vice versa), depending on the origins of the music playing over the sound system.

### Conclusion

 The more you are aware,the better choices you can make!!
 Knowing about these auditory clues can help you be more mindful about how you feel and react to food. In general, a better knowledge of the way we associate sound with flavour could lead to consious and healthy food choices.
